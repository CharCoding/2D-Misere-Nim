		<h2 style="margin-top: -5px;">Introduction</h2>
		<h3 style="margin-top: -5px;">Rules</h3>
		1. Player 1 and 2 each remove a rectangle of pieces each turn.
			- Doesn't matter if some pieces within the rectangle are already removed.
		2. Each player must remove at least 1 piece from the board.
		3. The person who has to remove the last piece loses.
		<h3>How to play</h3>
		- Hold down the mouse on the board and drag it to select pieces you want to remove. (highlighted in yellow)
			- If you want to cancel it, move the mouse button outside the board and release the mouse.
		- Release the mouse to remove those pieces and hand the turn to the opponent.
		- This game is really hard to play perfectly, so take your time and think about your opponent's possible moves.
		- Press Z to undo, Y to redo, R to reset (please don't cheat though)
		- If you enable the AI, please remove the squares it tells you on its turns. The AI isn't <i>that</i> smart. <b>Yet.</b>
		<h3>Hints (if you play perfectly)</h3>
		a. If you leave your opponent with a 2x2 square, you're winning.
		b. If your opponent leaves you with a 3x3 square, you're winning.
			- Take the center or one of the corners.
		c. If your opponent leaves you with a 3x4 square, you're winning.
			- Take the middle 2 from the long edge on either side.
